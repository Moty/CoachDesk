      "description": "The bug report identifies two issues: (1) README.md is missing documentation for new functions implemented in the marketing site (web-marketing/), and (2) the new dark glass theme needs to be applied to the main web frontend (/web). The marketing site contains 12 completed user stories with new components (Navbar, Hero, Destinations, ConciergeForm, MembershipTiers, Testimonials, FloatingMobileButton, Footer) and functions (validateForm, handleInterestToggle, handleSubmit) that are undocumented. Additionally, the marketing site implements a sophisticated dark glass theme with CSS variables, animated gradients, and glassmorphism effects in web-marketing/app/globals.css that should be applied to the main customer support frontend at /web. The current web frontend uses basic CSS styling in web/src/index.css and would benefit from the premium theming system.",
      "acceptanceCriteria": [
        "README.md includes a new 'Marketing Site Components' section documenting all 8 new components with their key features and functions",
        "README.md includes JSDoc-style documentation for the 3 key functions: validateForm(), handleInterestToggle(), and handleSubmit()",
        "The dark glass theme from web-marketing/app/globals.css is adapted and applied to web/src/index.css",
        "Web frontend components use the new CSS variables for consistent theming with the marketing site",
        "Existing web frontend functionality remains intact after theme application",
        "All frontend development commands and theme usage are documented in README.md"
