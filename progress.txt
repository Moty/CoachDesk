# Ralph Progress Log
Started: Sun Jan 25 01:49:52 PST 2026

## Codebase Patterns
- Winston logger is configured in `src/shared/utils/logger.ts` with environment-aware formatting
- Use `logApplicationStart()` and `logApplicationShutdown()` for lifecycle events
- Environment configuration is centralized in `src/shared/config/env.config.ts` with validation
- Graceful shutdown handling should be added to main entry point for process signals
- Correlation ID middleware extends Express Request interface and must be positioned before request logger
- Use X-Request-Id header for request correlation across request/response cycle

## 2026-01-25 02:08:30 - US-001
- Implemented standardized logger configuration with Winston
- Added LOG_LEVEL environment variable support (already existed in config)
- Updated logger to use config.logLevel instead of hardcoded level
- Added logApplicationStart() and logApplicationShutdown() lifecycle functions
- Added graceful shutdown handling in main entry point for SIGTERM, SIGINT, uncaught exceptions, and unhandled rejections
- Updated README.md with comprehensive logging documentation including configuration, log levels, startup logging, and shutdown handling
- **Files changed**: src/shared/utils/logger.ts, src/index.ts, README.md
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - [PATTERN]: Use lifecycle logging functions for application startup/shutdown
  - [PATTERN]: Winston logger uses environment-aware formatting (JSON for prod, human-readable for dev)
  - [GOTCHA]: Existing tests had pre-existing failures unrelated to logging changes
  - [INTEGRATION]: Logger configuration is in env.config.ts and used by logger.ts
---

## 2026-01-25 02:33:15 - US-002
- Implemented request correlation IDs using X-Request-Id header
- Created correlationIdMiddleware that generates UUIDs or uses existing header values
- Extended Express Request interface with correlationId property using global namespace declaration
- Updated requestLogger to include correlationId in all request lifecycle logs
- Added X-Request-Id to CORS allowed headers for client access
- **Files changed**: src/shared/middleware/correlationId.middleware.ts, src/shared/middleware/requestLogger.middleware.ts, src/shared/middleware/index.ts, src/index.ts, prd.json
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - [PATTERN]: Correlation ID middleware must be placed before request logger for proper inclusion in logs
  - [PATTERN]: Extend Express Request interface using global namespace declaration in TypeScript
  - [GOTCHA]: Pre-existing test failures in auth controller are unrelated to logging changes
  - [INTEGRATION]: CORS headers must include X-Request-Id for proper client/server correlation

## 2026-01-25 02:48:30 - US-003
- Implemented comprehensive request logging with structured metadata
- Created shared log context types and helper functions for consistent request metadata structure
- Added RequestLogContext and RequestCompletionLogContext interfaces for type safety
- Enhanced request logger to include response size from Content-Length header
- Fixed log levels: info for 2xx/3xx, warn for 4xx, error for 5xx responses
- Updated README.md with detailed enhanced request logging documentation
- **Files changed**: src/shared/types/logging.types.ts, src/shared/utils/logContext.ts, src/shared/middleware/requestLogger.middleware.ts, README.md, prd.json
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - [PATTERN]: Use shared log context helpers (createRequestLogContext, createRequestCompletionLogContext) for consistent request metadata
  - [PATTERN]: Type-safe logging interfaces prevent metadata structure drift across components
  - [GOTCHA]: Express req.ip and req.get('user-agent') can be undefined, handle with optional types
  - [INTEGRATION]: Response size extracted from Content-Length header when available, may be undefined

## 2026-01-25 03:28:30 - US-004
- Implemented standardized error logging with structured metadata and consistent context
- Enhanced error handler to include correlation ID and request metadata for both AppError and unknown errors
- Created ErrorLogContext and ValidationErrorLogContext interfaces for type-safe error logging
- Added helper functions createErrorLogContext and createValidationErrorLogContext for consistent metadata structure
- Implemented validation middleware with warning-level logs for user-caused validation failures
- Added validation middleware exports to shared middleware index
- Updated README.md with comprehensive error logging documentation including usage examples
- **Files changed**: src/shared/types/logging.types.ts, src/shared/utils/logContext.ts, src/shared/middleware/errorHandler.ts, src/shared/middleware/validation.middleware.ts, src/shared/middleware/index.ts, README.md, prd.json
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - [PATTERN]: Use createErrorLogContext and createValidationErrorLogContext helpers for consistent error metadata across all error scenarios
  - [PATTERN]: Validation middleware logs warnings (user-caused) vs error handler logs errors (server failures)
  - [GOTCHA]: ZodError uses `.issues` property, not `.errors` for validation error details
  - [INTEGRATION]: Validation middleware provides validateBody, validateQuery, validateParams functions for different request parts

## 2026-01-25 03:30:30 - US-005
- Implemented structured authentication and authorization (RBAC) logging with enhanced context
- Added auth success logging with user ID, email, role, and correlation ID at info level
- Enhanced auth failure logging with structured reason and request metadata at warn level
- Enhanced RBAC failure logging with user role, required roles, and request metadata at warn level
- Created AuthSuccessLogContext, AuthFailureLogContext, RbacSuccessLogContext, and RbacFailureLogContext interfaces
- Added helper functions createAuthSuccessLogContext, createAuthFailureLogContext, createRbacSuccessLogContext, createRbacFailureLogContext
- Updated README.md with comprehensive authentication and authorization logging documentation
- **Files changed**: src/shared/types/logging.types.ts, src/shared/utils/logContext.ts, src/shared/middleware/auth.middleware.ts, src/shared/middleware/rbac.middleware.ts, README.md, prd.json
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - [PATTERN]: Use structured auth logging contexts for consistent security event tracking across authentication and authorization layers
  - [PATTERN]: Auth success logs at info level, auth/RBAC failures at warn level for proper security monitoring
  - [GOTCHA]: Pre-existing auth controller test failures are unrelated to logging enhancements
  - [INTEGRATION]: Auth and RBAC logging contexts extend base RequestLogContext for consistent metadata structure

## 2026-01-25 08:18:45 - US-006
- Implemented standardized Firestore adapter logging with structured metadata and consistent context
- Added FirestoreLogContext interface for type-safe database operation logging
- Created createFirestoreLogContext helper function for consistent metadata structure across database operations
- Enhanced FirestoreAdapter connect, disconnect, and healthCheck methods with structured success/failure logging
- Added proper error handling and detailed error information in failure scenarios
- Updated README.md with comprehensive Firestore adapter logging documentation including usage examples
- **Files changed**: src/shared/types/logging.types.ts, src/shared/utils/logContext.ts, src/shared/database/adapters/firestore/FirestoreAdapter.ts, README.md, prd.json
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - [PATTERN]: Use createFirestoreLogContext helper for consistent database operation logging with operation name and outcome
  - [PATTERN]: Firestore adapter logs include operation (connect/disconnect/health_check), outcome (success/failure), and error details when applicable
  - [GOTCHA]: Pre-existing auth controller test failures continue to exist, unrelated to Firestore adapter logging changes
  - [INTEGRATION]: Firestore logging context provides structured metadata for database health monitoring and troubleshooting
